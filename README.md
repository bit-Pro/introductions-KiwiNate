Hello my name is Nathan and Im 20 years old (21 on March 16). I was a CITSS last year and am doing BIT now. My favorite Hobbies are listening to music (varying from the 1920's to the 90's, but mainly 50's, 60's and 70's, stuff like The Beatles and the Rolling Stones) and Classic British Comedy mostly from the 70's. My favorite aspects of IT is mostly the Hardware end, building and troubleshooting. VocSkills was a requirement due to CITSS.
